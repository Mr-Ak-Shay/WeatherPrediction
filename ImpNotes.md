# WeatherPrediction

You might have observed that my Pred Result was 8.04%, which is not the most ideal result.
I use a M1 Macbook Air, which is not High-Spec for it to run with multiple Parameters, and with a higher Epoch(some 50+) and Batch_size(some 64).
By adding, multiple paramaters and increasing the Epoch and Batch_size, it is certain that your Pred Results would range between 3%-5%, which is way better and more reliable.

This is just a Small-Scale of a higer project whihc could be developed.
